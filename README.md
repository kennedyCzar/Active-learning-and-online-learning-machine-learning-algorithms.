Onlin learning and Active learning ML algorithms

##### Online Learning [code](https://github.com/kennedyCzar/Active-learning-and-online-learning-machine-learning-algorithms./blob/master/Online%20Learning/onlinepassive.py) | [kernel version](https://github.com/kennedyCzar/Active-learning-and-online-learning-machine-learning-algorithms./blob/master/Online%20Learning/KERNEL%20ONLINE%20LEARNING/kernelonlinelearning.py)
##### Online learning is a binary classification algorithm which is an extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Unlike SVM where So that we update the weights using batches of data samples or all datasamples; here we only update the weights usng one example at a time. At every iteration, we only update the weight associated with the datasample until we reach the last index.
